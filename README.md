### Adversarial Attack

* [Adversarial_Image_Defenses](https://github.com/facebookresearch/adversarial_image_defenses)

  > This package implements the experiments described in the paper Countering Adversarial Images Using Input Transformations. It contains implementations for adversarial attacks, defenses based image transformations, training, and testing convolutional networks under adversarial attacks using our defenses. 
  
  > Pros: The code implements the following four approaches to generating adversarial images:
  > **Fast gradient sign method (FGSM), Iterative FGSM, DeepFool, Carlini-Wagner attack**
  
  > Cons: Pytorch version is v0.2 :pensive:
